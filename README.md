Relationship Conversion Folder
This folder holds everything related to relationship conversion for energy dataset. Method 1 simple average deals the data with simple averaging, ignoring the county/zip code boundary complications. Method 2 weighted average takes this into account. The result after method two is called monthly_avg_bycounty.csv to be validated with actual data. 
Just in case you get lost, open the two ipynb files and how each file in this folder is used is detailedly explicated in the markdown cells. Contact jiaxinli1999@berkeley.edu for any questions for this folder.

Have fun!
